# Elevator Pitch
Feedback is very important to successful businesses. Unfortunately, feedback can come in a variety of sources such as face-to-face interaction, an email/text/IM, a third-party application, and many others. As a result, feedback becomes arbitrary and unsorted, making it difficult for the business to understand and act on the feedback. Creating a web application that allows for a centralized place to give/post, receive, examine, and comment on given feedback is the intended solution for this problem. It will allow the employee the option to choose to either submit a free-form feedback posting and/or comment on posts confidentially with the option to make yourself known. This will be a public and transparent digital board for the eyes of all internal employees of the company.
